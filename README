Narwhal is a project of the Illini 4000 (http://illini4000.org)

This repo is the /app folder of a CakePHP app.

You will need CakePHP 1.3, Apache, MySQL, some gumption, and Narwhal food to run it. For more info on making this stack play nicely: http://book.cakephp.org/1.3/en/view/1528/Blog.

Further, copy core.php.copy and database.php.copy to core.php and database.php, respectively in /config. 

Next, fill in the cipher seed and security salt in core.php and database connection values in database.php with your own values. (core.php and database.php have been .gitignore'd for security reasons)

Happy Narwhal Tracking!
